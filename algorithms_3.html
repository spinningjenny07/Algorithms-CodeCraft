// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦

// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed two million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. (hint: if (a % 2 == 0) { ... })
var fibA = 0;
var fibB = 1;
var arrFib = [];
	for (var i = 0; i < 29; i++) {
		arrFib.push(fibA + fibB);
		for (var i = 0; i < 29; i++) {
			fibA = fibB;
			fibB = arrFib[i];
			arrFib[i] = fibA;
			arrFib.push(fibB + arrFib[i]);
		}
	}

	console.log(arrFib);

var fibEvens = [ ];
for (var j = 0; j < 2000000; j++) {
	if (arrFib[j] % 2 === 0) {
		fibEvens.push(arrFib[j]);
	}
}
	console.log(fibEvens);

	var sum = 0; //keep track of the sum so far
	var index = 0; //keep track of where we are

	while (index < fibEvens.length) {
    	sum = sum + fibEvens[index];
    	index = index + 1;
    }

		console.log(sum);
		// When I create the original array I have an extra 1 that gets pushed into the array that I can't figure out how to get rid of. For this problem it doesn't affect anything b/c I'm only looking for even numbers. I recognize that it would cause a problem in some other senario involving odd numbers or the entire array.
